    <h4>preparation</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix all the dry components (flour, salt, sugar, yeast) together in a
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the water. Mix until combined, i.e. no more loose flour.
        (Recommended handmixer, hands work too.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the oil. Mix until combined smoothly, i.e. no more visible shiny
        oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now mix for at least 10 more minutes by hand. Or continue to use the
        handmixer, for about 5 minutes. In general the result will just get
        better the longer you mix, do not overdo it however.
      </li>
      <li>
        Split the dough into <span class="portions">2</span> equal portions by
        weight. Place each in a pre-oiled bowl. Make sure to swirl the dough
        around in the bowl so it too is oiled from all sides.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Let the dough rise, for about 20-35 minutes (depending on room
      temperature), or until just about doubled in size.
    </p>
    <h4>baking</h4>
    <p>
      For extra brown crust in an oven that does not get very hot, pre-bake each
      spread out portion with just the sauce and any other hard ingredients for
      about 3 minutes. Then add the chesse and let bake until gold brown.
